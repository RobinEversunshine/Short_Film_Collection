# Short Film Collection
Some scripts to create pages in my short film collection Notion database using video links of youtube or bilibili.

I created a Notion database to store all kinds of animated short films, motion designs, and visual effects. As you can see I also classify them by adding tags, sometimes also leave a comment on them.

I have a rougher short film collection in my bilibili account (basically Chinese version of youtube), but what I did in the past few years is just dumping a film into a collection after I finish it. It makes things difficult to try to find some certain genre of films. But by using tags and comments,Â it will make my life much easier next time I try to find some inspiration from short films.

I'm using a script I wrote to import film information (name, description, duration, upload time, etc.) to my Notion database by inputting a video link. But I also need to many manual work like finding original video links (from youtube and vimeo) and other resources, like behind the scenes that connected to each film.
